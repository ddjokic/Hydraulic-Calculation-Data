###Hydraulic Calculation Data

Set of excel files with various data necessary to perform Headloss calculation of piping system:  

- Fluids.xlsx - data about fluids (kin. viscosity, density, vapour pressure). Over 200 fluids in the base;

- FrictionalLosses.xls - given only for the guidance. Fluid is fresh water @ 20 degC and flow is in full turbulent regime;

- k_factors.csv - local (minor) losses (k-method) as used in my scripts;

- Local Losses.xls - same as above, but in excel spreadsheet

- Local Losses - Additional.xls - more complete list of local losses (k-method). Will include in my scripts, probably;

- PipeRoughnes.xls - roughness data for various pipe materials;

- ViscosityConversion.xls - use with care

Feel free to add new entries to the lists.


Again, no warranty of any kind.
